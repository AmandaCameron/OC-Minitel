# syslog Daemon for OpenOS

The syslog daemon lives in */etc/rc.d/syslogd.lua*, and as such is managed as an rc program:

```
rc syslogd enable
rc syslogd start
rc syslogd reload
```

In addition, the daemon keeps a configuration file in */etc/syslogd.cfg*. This is stored as a Lua table and may be edited in whatever way you see fit. It has the following fields and default values:

|Field		| Default value	|
| ---		| ---		|
|port		| 514		|
|relay		| false		|
|relayhost	| ""		|
|receive	| false		|
|write		| true		|
|destination	| "/dev/null"	|
|minlevel	| 6		|
|beeplevel	| -1		|
|displevel	| 2		|
|filter		| {}		|
