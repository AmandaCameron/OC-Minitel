# realtime-sync

realtime synchronisation daemon for OpenOS

realtime-sync uses the Date: header in HTTP responses, using the Internet card, to ascertain the current real time in UTC, and updates the realtime library with this information.

## Usage

realtime-sync is implemented as an rc service, and as such, to start it one can use the usual rc commands:

    rc realtime-sync start  
    rc realtime-sync stop  
    rc realtime-sync enable  
    rc realtime-sync disable

Additionally, realtime-sync includes

    rc realtime-sync sync

to force a re-synchronisation.

## Configuration

realtime-sync includes a configuration file at */etc/realtime-sync.cfg*; as a Lua table. It contains the following fields:

- **url**: The URL to request to get the time. Pick one that returns UTC dates in the headers, or leave the default.
- **offset**: The timezone offset, in hours. For example, for AEDT, use 11.
- **frequency**: The time between automatic time synchronisations.
