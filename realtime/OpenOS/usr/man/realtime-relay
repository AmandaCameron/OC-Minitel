# realtime-relay

realtime relay daemon for OpenOS

realtime-relay is both a Minitel realtime server and client; allowing both synchronisation with another machine, and other machines to synchronise with the local machine's clock.

## Usage

realtime-relay is implemented as an rc service, and as such, to start it one can use the usual rc commands:

    rc realtime-relay start  
    rc realtime-relay stop  
    rc realtime-relay enable  
    rc realtime-relay disable

## Configuration

realtime-relay includes a configuration file at */etc/realtime-relay.cfg*; as a Lua table. It contains the following fields:

- **host**: The host to synchronise the local real-time clock with.
- **port**: The port to communicate with *host* on.
- **sync**: Whether to synchronise clocks with *host*.
- **frequency**: The time between automatic time synchronisations.
- **offset**: The offset time, in hours.

By default, realtime-relay will only act as a server, as using it as a client requires both a *host* being set, and *sync* being enabled.
