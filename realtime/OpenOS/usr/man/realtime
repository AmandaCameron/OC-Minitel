# realtime

realtime is a library for OpenOS providing a reasonably accurate current real-world time, given the right input (see realtime-sync and realtime-relay).

## API

### realtime.time(*utc*)

Returns the current time, either respecting the current offset, or if *utc* is set, with no offset.

### realtime.update(*epoch*, *uptime*, *offset*)

Updates the currently known real time, with the time as *epoch*, measured at *uptime*. Optionally, an offset can be provided.
