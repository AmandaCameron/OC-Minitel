# Minitel - Minitel daemon for OpenOS

The Minitel daemon handles receiving and relaying Minitel packets.

## Configuration

The minitel daemon keeps a settings file in /etc/minitel.cfg, which is loaded on start. This can be edited directly and the daemon restarted, or settings can be changed from the command line.

To change a setting, one invokes:

`rc minitel set <option> <value>`

### Available settings

- port: the physical port the protocol runs over
- pctime: the amount of time packets are kept in the packet cache
- retry: how many seconds between resend attempts of reliable packets
- rctime: How long items are kept in the routing cache
- retrycount: how many attempts to resend should be made
- route: whether to forward packets
- debug: whether to output debugging info to the display

In addition, one can invoke to get large amounts of debug output, *rc minitel set_route <hostname> <local_modem> <remote_modem>* to add a static route, and *rc minitel del_route <hostname>* to delete a static route.
