# Minitel - Minitel daemon for OpenOS

The Minitel daemon handles receiving and relaying Minitel packets.

## Configuration

The minitel daemon does not keep a configuration file, so settings have to be set every boot.

To change a setting, one invokes:

`rc minitel set_<option> value`

### Available settings

 - port: the physical port the protocol runs over
 - pctime: the amount of time packets are kept in the packet cache
 - retry: how many seconds between resend attempts of reliable packets
 - rctime: How long items are kept in the routing cache

In addition, one can invoke `rc minitel debug` to get large amounts of debug output, rc `minitel set_route <local_modem> <remote_modem>` to add a static route, and `rc minitel del_route` to delete a static route.
