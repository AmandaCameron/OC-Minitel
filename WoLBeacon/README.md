# WoLBeacon

WoLBeacon is a piece of software written to wake other computers up, and keep them awake, like force-feeding your friends coffee.

This is achieved by both setting the wake message for the local machine, and broadcasting wake-on-LAN messages at regular intervals.

## [WoLBeacon for OpenOS](OpenOS/)

WoLBeacon is implemented as an rc daemon for OpenOS.
